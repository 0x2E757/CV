    <p class="motivation ff-kalam">
      Became interested in programming at the age of 6, started studying web
      development at 10, and began freelancing at 16. Naturally arrived at the
      principles of SOLID, DRY, and KISS before even learned about them. Love
      simple algorithms that do complex things, especially metaprogramming.
      Accustomed to reading other's code, as well as third-party library code.
      Don't have problems working in a team and always open to discussions.
